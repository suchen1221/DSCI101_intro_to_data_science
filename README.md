# DSCI101_intro_to_data_science

## COURSE DESCRIPTION:
In this course, students learn the fundamentals of data science and Python programming while working on teams to solve real data science challenges, manipulate and wrangle with data, and derive and communicate valuable insights from data. This is a non-calculus-based course with no prior background in statistics or programming required.

## COURSE OVERVIEW:
This is an introductory level course where students learn about fundamentals and principles in data science by completing hands-on, real-world data analysis in teams. During the semester, class will meet for three times each week. Lectures will cover course material and introduce tools students need to complete the weekly assignments which allow students to apply the knowledge and techniques to real-world dataset. One lab session each week will be devoted to students working on these assignments as a team under the guidance of the instructor. These assignments are designed to assess studentsâ€™ understanding and check their progress as they move forward along the data science pipeline. Course content includes foundations in managing and analyzing data; data mining techniques and tools; exploratory data analysis and data visualization; applied statistical methods and inference; machine learning algorithms and predictive models. This course will use Python and teach fundamentals of Python programming for data analysis. 

## COURSE OBJECTIVES & LEARNING OUTCOMES:
In this course, students will engage in experiential learning where they will learn the basics of data science and programming through solving a real-world data science challenge. Students will learn how to wrangle, explore and model data to extract useful information and knowledge from data. Students completing this course will be able to:
- Define and explain key concepts in the data science pipeline and work as a team to complete data science life cycle and analyze real-world data.
- Gain fluency in basic programming skills in Python with a focus on statistical modeling and machine learning.
- Use applied statistical knowledge to analyze data, derive data summaries, build predictive models, and make scientific inference.
- Interpret modeling results and communicate their findings to both a general and a technical audience.
